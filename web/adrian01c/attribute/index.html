    <p>In order to be considered for being accepted as a starter student in the CodeTap Academy, please let us know more about you by answering the following questions. I actually intend to keep this as short as possible before you can start with the questions. There are over 30 hires and promotions that CodeTap facilitated through its methods and we’ve managed to raise the average a student earns in the first year to over £35000 per annum. We’ll always be opened to hear you out and consider your suggestions while we ask of you to try at least once everything we ask of you to do in order to be as efficient as possible, as quick as possible, to be the best version you can be in the process of achieving a lot of power and a lot of freedom in your life.</p>
    <p>A successful developer invests as much time as humanly possible into sharpening their skills and increasing their knowledge and influence. How many hours per week can you dedicate to become a web developer?
      Less than 2 hours
      Between 2 to 5 hours
      Between 5 and 10 hours
      More than 10 hours
      Every bit of time I have and at least 10 hours
      Other, please specify ………………………………...
      </p>
      <p>Some people tend to say: I’m going to start in 10 days, or I’ll have a quick break. Most of those people don’t make it as they introduce the possibility of “not doing your best at coding”. Are you going to make becoming a web developer your number one priority, everything else would have to wait its turn?
        Yes
        No
        Other, please specify ………………………………...
        </p>
        <p>At work, most companies follow the agile process, where the team gathers around each day and each member gives an update about his progress and each member listens and acknowledges other members progress. Are you going to give your update for the daily stand-up, in a video format recorded with your phone or camera, uploaded on YouTube, each and every day, without missing one? Are you also going to listen to everyone else's update without missing even one?
          Yes
          No
          Other, please specify ………………………………...
          </p>
          <p>The previous question was quite important, maybe you didn’t realise that. It’s about doing an update every day and that you make sure you don't miss any of your other workmates, students or mentors updates. Can you please read the previous question again and reconfirm your answer?</p>

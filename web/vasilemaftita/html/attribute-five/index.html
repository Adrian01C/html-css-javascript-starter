      The Environment Agency predicts 75% of rivers in England and along the
      Scottish and Welsh borders will meet EU expectations by 2027, compared
      with just 14% now, but the WWF believes these targets are ‘very unlikely’
      to be met. Dr Andrew Singer, senior scientist at the Centre for Ecology
      and Hydrology, said Britain’s rivers are being used like sewers, with
      human waste allowed to discharge into waters.‘Our rivers are the lifeblood
      of the countryside ― vital for wildlife and people, as well as our
      economy.

      ‘As we prepare to leave the EU, the UK government must fast-track flagship
      legislation to better protect and restore our waterways.‘[They must also]
      invest in effective monitoring and enforcement to ensure water companies
      and agricultural industry can no longer use our rivers as open
      sewers.’There are more than 18,000 sewer overflows across England and
      Wales ― and about 90% of them discharge raw sewage directly into rivers,
      according to the WWF. Overflows are supposed to occur only during extreme
      rainfall to prevent sewage backing up into homes, but in 2017 the charity
      found 8-14% of overflows spilling sewage into rivers at least once a week,
      and between a third and a half at least once a month.

      Sewage pollution has dire effects, causing rapid algae growth and starving
      the river of the oxygen that wildlife needs to survive. This affects
      animals like otters and kingfishers that prey on aquatic life. However, in
      some parts of the country, work is being done to improve the situation.

      Local microbiologist Ann Darracott reports very healthy readings for the
      waterways in Maidenhead, Berkshire and the reaches between the towns of
      Maidenhead and Marlow now host a number of otters. A mixture of weeds and
      litter were cleared from Maidenhead Waterways, as volunteers in boats
      removed 58 bags of refuse in an effort to improve the beauty of the town.
      The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Council also passed a
      biodiversity motion last week.

      Understanding The Colors Of Our Life Some time ago, I stumbled upon this
      quote: Every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the
      limits of the world. — Arthur Schopenhauer As with any good quote, it
      feels right and obvious, and you don’t ponder on it too much. It’s because
      today, we seek for something extraordinary, something unique and
      different. But if to take some time and think about it, some interesting
      insights can pop up. Below is the one I had.
    </h1>
    <h2>
      We All Start As Blank Slates Although we may have some genetic
      knowledge/information at birth, we do not have any understanding of the
      world around us. However, once we come into this world, we start to learn.
      And that’s where it all starts. Life Is Colorful Among the first things
      that we learn in life is to discern between good and bad. We gradually
      find ourselves in a black and white world, where some things that we do
      are good, and others are bad. These are the first “colors” that we learn
      about in life.
    </h2>
    <p>
      You broke mum’s favorite vase — it’s bad. You asked for the chamber pot —
      it’s good. You ate all your food — it’s good. And so on… You start to
      understand the outer world in terms of bad and good and can orient and
      make some decisions based on your understanding of the world. At the same
      time, you start to learn some new “colors.” You realize that something you
      thought of as being “bad” is actually called pain, while other things you
      thought as being “good” are actually joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so you grow, discovering life’s colors and enriching your spectrum of
      understanding. In the first 5–10 years of your life, you will learn
      several primary colors that will let you navigate in this world more or
      less safely. You will get to know the colors of love, joy, surprise,
      anger, sadness, and fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you grow older, you might start to differentiate between similar colors
      you previously thought of as a single color. You realize that pain can be
      physical and can be psychological, or that joy can come from your optimism
      or from eating a delicious piece of cake. Thus, based on your experience,
      you learn new colors similar to ones that you already know. At the same
      time, besides teaching us new hues, life gives us lessons, sometimes tough
      ones, that reveal the same color, but from the “opposite” side. In our
      teens, we learn that love can also hurt or that mild pain can be pleasant
      (e.g., after exercising at the gym). We learn the antipodes of some colors
      that we already know.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time a person reaches his twentieth birthday, they can distinguish
      between 10–15 different colors on average. These are emotions and
      character traits that one can differentiate.There are dark as well as
      light and bright colors. For some people, darker colors can predominate,
      while for others, more luminous colors are central. But regardless of
      which one dominates, there are no people with only dark or bright hues.
      The Ups And Downs Of Our Life We all live our lives through the prism of
      our experiences and emotions. And we all want to live a happy life.
      Therefore, the colors of life that we learn throughout our journey on
      Earth represent how we are able to see and interpret the world around us.
      It may seem that learning new colors is effortless and can go on
      indefinitely. However, after the first 10–15 colors, you must put in more
      effort to learn a new hue, and this process can even hurt, sometimes
      badly. Also, it might seem that “dark colors” are useless, that life would
      be much better if there were no such colors, but these are as important in
      one’s life as “bright colors.” Here’s why:
    </p>
    <p>
      Can you tell me how happy a person with the above happiness level can be
      given that their level of happiness was constant for three months?The
      reality could be any of the above, except that it might not make any
      difference in the long run. The reason here is our exceptional ability to
      adjust to our reality. As Jonathan Haidt mentions in his book, “The
      Happiness Hypothesis”: Within a year, lottery winners and paraplegics have
      both (on average) returned most of the way to their baseline levels of
      happiness [Harlow, Harlow, and Meyer, 1950]. The lottery winner buys a new
      house and a new car, quits her boring job, and eats better food. She gets
      a kick out of the contrast with her former life, but within a few months,
      the contrast blurs, and the pleasure fades. Therefore, contrast is
      essential, and without life’s downs, there would be no ups, as we simply
      wouldn’t be able to tell the difference. And even if life would go only
      up, we wouldn’t know this, because, again, we would have nothing to
      compare it to. But we do have all these colors, and we can compare them.
      And that can make our life more colorful.
    </p>
    <p>
      We All See Things Differently Yes, we have different perspectives on
      things, which is not a groundbreaking discovery (that’s actually no
      discovery at all). Yet in our day-to-day communication and interaction
      with other people, aside from the information that we possess, we choose
      how to behave and react in different cases according to our palette. You
      may choose between aggressiveness, understanding, empathy, apathy,
      openmindedness, friendliness, indifference, worry, and many more colors…
      if you’ve learned them. It is probably easy to assume that people know all
      these concepts and can differentiate between them, but you would be
      surprised to learn how many do not broaden their primary colors' palette.
      Some people just know only 10–15 hues, and that’s it. Every other emotion
      they encounter in the world, if they do not wish to put the effort to
      understand and learn it, is simply labeled with one of the existing
      colors. They can easily label empathy, compassion, affliction, remorse as
      weakness; or optimism, enthusiasm, delight, as joy. We can see millions of
      colors with our eyes, but each of us lives in their own world. And that
      world might look very different from one person to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the images above, as well as below, the top left picture is represented
      with only 10 colors. The top right image has only 15 colors. The bottom
      left photo is represented by 50 colors. And the bottom right is the
      original.Thus, discerning between different experiences makes up for a
      richer, more colorful life, while relying on the basic ones and labeling
      everything else according to one’s own limited experience makes them see
      similar images all around. Probably that’s one of the reasons why older
      people are happier. Their broader palette makes them see and understand
      the world in much more detail (as a side note — not all old people have
      this varied palette. Some of them still rely on several colors only).
      Besides the fact that darker colors make bright colors brighter, a diverse
      number of colors that you learn throughout life make you able to adopt the
      best behavior in different situations (more on this below).

      Learning New Colors This is a fascinating process, but there is no exact
      rule by which to follow. However, there are several ways you can broaden
      your palette. 1. You Can See A New “Color” By Yourself Time flows, and
      with it, our life goes on, bringing us days after days, full of people,
      events, and thoughts. We get exposed to new colors when something changes
      in our lives. We may win, or we may lose (people, relatives, money, jobs,
      etc.). What is important here is that we should be mindful and understand
      what color we are exposed to. Remember that in most cases, the natural
      tendency is to label it to something that we already know, thus failing to
      learn an important lesson that might help us in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. You Can Mix Colors This often happens unconsciously, and “mixing
      colors” is more of a metaphor (along with the entire article). Yet, in
      order to mix colors, you need to have a sufficient number of them. As with
      real colors (for instance, when mixing yellow and blue, you get green), by
      mixing character traits and emotional colors, you can get rid of (or
      transform) some color that predominates in your life right now (e.g., if
      you are depressed [dark color], you may throw in your life some bright
      colors specific to you that may alleviate your depression), or you can
      discover new colors. This discovery of new colors, especially when these
      are bright colors, is a very intense experience. I had such an experience
      after a TEDxChisinau event. I was the co-host of the event, and after a
      day full of great people and inspiring ideas, we went to the after-party,
      where we had some wine and random chats with speakers and attendees of the
      event. It was a great evening. But after it, when I was heading home,
      tired, I discovered a new state, a new color. It was a mix of enthusiasm,
      melancholy, determination, and tranquility. It was so strange, yet so
      inspiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Someone Can Show You A Color This one happens less often, yet the
      colors that other people show you are also quite intense. And sometimes,
      these people may be complete strangers. Random acts of kindness from
      people you do not know is one of such examples. A wonderful feeling and a
      bright color that I learned came from a person that I’ve met only five
      times in my life. It is a feeling of mindfulness, authenticity, serenity,
      and a sense of strong positive energy that goes from the person all at
      once. I call it sidnicity, — a state of mind when you feel content and
      full of life; when you feel a strong connection to a person.
      Unfortunately, that person passed away, but that color of sidnicity he
      taught me made my life brighter. I’ve re-experienced sidnicity after that.
      Another great person that made me feel similar. Yet this time, I
      recognized that feeling, and I was able to savor and enjoy it.

      Viewing The World We Live In Through Different Glasses Probably you’ve
      heard the phrase “view the world through rose-colored glasses.” But it is
      perfectly valid to substitute “rose” with any other color. When we grow
      up, we may choose (or we may be forced to choose by our environment)
      several favorite colors. Some may choose dark colors (discrimination,
      hate, intolerance), while others may choose bright colors (empathy,
      optimism, thankfulness). And then we view the world “through [green/dark
      violet/gray/brown/red/dark blue]-colored glasses” (the meaning of each
      color depends on the person). But sometimes we may choose (or, again, be
      forced) to change the glasses. Yet other times, although rarely, we look
      at the world through no glasses at all, enjoying its beauty at maximum.
      And if you view the world through some color-tinted glasses, and you’re
      thinking that everything is the same, remember that the world is diverse.
      There are other hues out there that can make your life more colorful.
      Acknowledge that your perception might be narrow and skewed and look to
      broaden the limits of your worldview. It takes a lot of effort to do that.
      But being able to see the world in its full beauty is worth striving for.

      romantic and believe in drama, warmth, and empathy to all relationships. 
      I enjoy the symbols of romance such as flowers, candlelight, and music and
      cherish the small gestures of affection.BLUES...in childhood  I was
      extremely imaginative and found it difficult to fit into the structure of

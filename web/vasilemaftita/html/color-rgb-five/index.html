      The importance of colors in our life There is no denying the link between
      colors and our emotions, and we even have an abundance of idioms to show
      what way each color can affect your mood. It can be a small thing, such as
      gazing out the window at a patch of green for a few minutes or wearing
      something bright on a rainy day.

      The first might calm you down or help you refocus, while the latter will
      give you a boost of energy on a day when you would typically be running
      low. There are a few reasons why we react to colors the way we do. Our
      relationship with colors Not everybody will react the same way to the same
      color. Colors influence us on a few different levels. On one hand, we are
      conditioned socially and culturally (we mourn in black and wear white
      mostly in the summer) and on the other hand, our reaction is also
      personal, influenced by how this color is presented in our own lives.

      Red is typically associated with a sense of urgency. It represents danger
      and forces us to become more alert, more active. But it might also be one
      of the colors in your grandma’s kitchen, making you feel warm, loved, and
      safe instead. Warm vs. cool colors Colors are commonly divided into two
      categories: warm and cool colors. Warm colors such as red, orange, yellow,
      and combinations of these provide the illusion of heat and warmth because
      they remind us of sunlight or heath. Visually, warm colors will appear
      closer or like they are advancing towards you.

      Cool colors such as blue, purple, and green provide a sense of calm and
      relaxation because they are a visual reminder of elements of nature like
      water, sky, and grass. Opposite to warm colors, cool colors look as though
      they are further away or receding from us. Surrounding yourself with the
      right colors can improve your mood, relieve stress, and help you get a
      good night’s sleep.So how do you pick the right colors for yourself? The
      most important thing is to create an environment that will have the right
      amount of both colors and will not side too heavily in one direction only.
      For example, a little boost of yellow is a great visual pick-me-up but too
      much will distract you and can even make you agitated in the long run.

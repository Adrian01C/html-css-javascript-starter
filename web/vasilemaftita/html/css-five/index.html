      History of English; The history of the English language really started
      with the arrival of three Germanic tribes who invaded Britain during the
      5th century AD. These tribes, the Angles, the Saxons and the Jutes,
      crossed the North Sea from what today is Denmark and northern Germany. At
      that time the inhabitants of Britain spoke a Celtic language. But most of
      the Celtic speakers were pushed west and north by the invaders - mainly
      into what is now Wales, Scotland and Ireland. The Angles came from
      "Englaland" [sic] and their language was called "Englisc" - from which the
      words "England" and "English" are derived
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Old English (450-1100 AD) The invading Germanic tribes spoke similar
      languages, which in Britain developed into what we now call Old English.
      Old English did not sound or look like English today. Native English
      speakers now would have great difficulty understanding Old English.
      Nevertheless, about half of the most commonly used words in Modern English
      have Old English roots. The words be, strong and water, for example,
      derive from Old English. Old English was spoken until around 1100.

      Middle English (1100-1500) In 1066 William the Conqueror, the Duke of
      Normandy (part of modern France), invaded and conquered England. The new
      conquerors (called the Normans) brought with them a kind of French, which
      became the language of the Royal Court, and the ruling and business
      classes. For a period there was a kind of linguistic class division, where
      the lower classes spoke English and the upper classes spoke French. In the
      14th century English became dominant in Britain again, but with many
      French words added. This language is called Middle English. It was the
      language of the great poet Chaucer (c1340-1400), but it would still be
      difficult for native English speakers to understand today./Modern English
      Early Modern English (1500-1800) Towards the end of Middle English, a
      sudden and distinct change in pronunciation (the Great Vowel Shift)
      started, with vowels being pronounced shorter and shorter. From the 16th
      century the British had contact with many peoples from around the world.
      This, and the Renaissance of Classical learning, meant that many new words
      and phrases entered the language. The invention of printing also meant
      that there was now a common language in print. Books became cheaper and
      more people learned to read. Printing also brought standardization to
      English. Spelling and grammar became fixed, and the dialect of London,
      where most publishing houses were, became the standard. In 1604 the first
      English dictionary was published.

      Late Modern English (1800-Present) The main difference between Early
      Modern English and Late Modern English is vocabulary. Late Modern English
      has many more words, arising from two principal factors: firstly, the
      Industrial Revolution and technology created a need for new words;
      secondly, the British Empire at its height covered one quarter of the
      earth's surface, and the English language adopted foreign words from many
      countries. Varieties of English From around 1600, the English colonization
      of North America resulted in the creation of a distinct American variety
      of English. Some English pronunciations and words "froze" when they
      reached America. In some ways, American English is more like the English
      of Shakespeare than modern British English is. Some expressions that the
      British call "Americanisms" are in fact original British expressions that
      were preserved in the colonies while lost for a time in Britain (for
      example trash for rubbish, loan as a verb instead of lend, and fall for
      autumn; another example, frame-up, was re-imported into Britain through
      Hollywood gangster movies). Spanish also had an influence on American
      English (and subsequently British English), with words like canyon, ranch,
      stampede and vigilante being examples of Spanish words that entered
      English through the settlement of the American West. French words (through
      Louisiana) and West African words (through the slave trade) also
      influenced American English (and so, to an extent, British English).
      Today, American English is particularly influential, due to the USA's
      dominance of cinema, television, popular music, trade and technology
      (including the Internet). But there are many other varieties of English
      around the world, including for example Australian English, New Zealand
      English, Canadian English, South African English, Indian English and
      Caribbean English.

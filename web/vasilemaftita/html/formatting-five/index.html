      Police have warned hare coursers that their vehicles could be seized and
      crushed if they are caught and convicted. Suffolk Constabulary, in
      conjunction with rural organisations, has demonstrated the potential
      consequences for offenders who are caught hare coursing.
    </h1>
    <h2>
      The force has warned that strong action against those involved in the
      illegal activity will be taken, with one potential outcome that any
      vehicles used could be crushed. Anyone convicted of the offence can also
      receive a fine of up to £5,000 by a magistrates’ court. Hare coursing,
      illegal in the UK under the Hunting Act 2004, is a blood-sport where dogs
      are used to chase, catch and kill hares. In Suffolk during the period 1
      September 2019 to 31 March 2020, there were 139 hare coursing incidents
      reported, with most occurring on farmland.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Under the banner of Operation Galileo forces from across the UK work
      together sharing intelligence on hare coursers planning to trespass. Sgt
      Brian Calver from the Suffolk Rural Crime and Wildlife Team said hare
      coursing was a 'huge issue' for farmers and landowners. "This illegal
      activity damages property, threatens people's incomes and subjects people
      to fear and intimidation," he said. "Many of those are very unpleasant
      with violent and unscrupulous backgrounds, many of whom have links to
      organised criminality. "Significant sums of money can change hands in the
      form of illegal betting and gambling on the outcome." The NFU added that
      the crime of hare coursing was a serious problem, which often left farmers
      'isolated, desperate and powerless'.
    </p>
    <p>
      The union, along with the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), has
      called for legislation to be strengthened to help police better tackle the
      crime."As well as the illegal killing of wildlife, coursers damage crops,
      hedges and gates and they are prepared to use violence and intimidation
      against farmers," NFU County Adviser Charles Hesketh said. "Police in
      Suffolk are taking action and have had a number of success recently in
      catching offenders, but we want the legislation strengthened. "This
      includes amendments to make it easier for the police to seize dogs from
      coursers and for the courts to impose tougher penalties.” It comes as
      farmers are being asked to confidentially share evidence of the real
      prevalence of hare coursing amid fears the crime is significantly
      underreported. The Yorkshire Agricultural Society (YAS) launched the
      survey in collaboration with the National Rural Crime Network, NFU and the
      CLA.

      Farmers can now apply to take part in the Sustainable Farming Incentive's
      pilot scheme, with agreements expected to roll out from October.
      Expressions of interests to participate in the post-Brexit agricultural
      scheme opened on Monday (15 March) and will close on 11 April. Farmers and
      land managers will need to complete a short online form to submit their
      interest in taking part in the pilot.
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Successful candidates will be invited to complete their application and,
      if eligible, they will enter into a pilot agreement starting from October
      2021. The scheme will support approaches to farming that deliver for the
      environment, such as actions to improve soil health, hedgerows and
      integrated pest management. For example, a farmer might be paid to manage
      and plant hedgerows to provide year-round food, shelter and breeding cover
      for birds and insects.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For the pilot's first phase, payment rates for land management actions
      will be set at a broadly equivalent level to rates under Countryside
      Stewardship, Defra has confirmed. It said this was a starting position
      only and updated payment rates for the launch of the Sustainable Farming
      Incentive from 2022 were being developed. In the first phase, participants
      will be able to select from an initial set of eight standards to build
      their own agreements. These are: Arable and horticultural land standard;
      arable and horticultural soils standard; improved grassland standard;
      improved grassland soils standard; low and no input grassland standard;
      hedgerow standard; on farm woodland standard; waterbody buffering
      standard. The standards aim to promote cleaner air and water, and guard
      against environmental risks such as climate change and flooding. Within
      each standard there are three levels for participants to choose from –
      Introductory, Intermediate and Advanced. Defra explained that each level
      is more challenging, and more rewarding, than the previous level and
      delivers greater environmental benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      This initial stage will be open to 'several hundred farmers', with an aim
      to reflect England’s distribution of farm types and locations. Pilot
      participants will be asked to take part in a range of co-design
      activities, providing feedback on their experience of all aspects of the
      process. Defra said this would ensure the scheme was 'fully workable and
      user-friendly' once fully rolled out from 2024. Environment Secretary
      George Eustice said the Sustainable Farming Incentive would support the
      environment and promote animal welfare. "It will reward approaches to farm
      husbandry such as encouraging integrated pest management, improving soil
      health and enhancing hedgerows. “Assets that were previously dubbed
      “ineligible features” will finally have their value recognised and
      rewarded. "I would encourage farmers to engage in this pilot to help us
      design the new scheme," Mr Eustice said.

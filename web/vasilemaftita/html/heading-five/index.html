    <h1>Is it healthier to live in the countryside?</h1>
    <h2>
      If research suggesting that people who live close to major roads could
      have a higher risk of dementia has prompted thoughts of clean,
      traffic-free countryside living, then you are probably not alone.
    </h2>
    <p>
      But what is the reality? Is a rural existence better for our health? Like
      the causes of dementia itself, it is not a straightforward question and
      there are no clear-cut answers. On the face of it, fleeing to the
      countryside seems like a good idea. Less than a quarter of the UK
      population lives there for a start.

      The air is cleaner, there is less traffic and air pollution - which
      increases the risk of stroke, lung cancer, heart disease and respiratory
      diseases - is not an issue. There is also more opportunity to get out and
      exercise in all that open space - remember those long dog walks you have
      been fantasising about - and enjoy being surrounded by greenery.

      Longer life According to David Newby, British Heart Foundation professor
      of cardiology at the University of Edinburgh, when it comes to air
      pollution, "being in the country is better for you".
    </h1>
    <h2>
      That is because living away from busy roads reduces the risk of damage to
      the lungs and heart from fine particles and gases emitted by traffic.
      While buses, high-rise buildings and stop-go traffic are known to increase
      the risk of exposure to pollution, Prof Newby says you do not have to move
      far to reduce the health risk.
    </h2>

      "The closer you are to a major road the worse it is, but moving to the
      middle of Hyde Park could be sufficient," he said. Roy Harrison, professor
      of environmental health at the University of Birmingham, says it is
      "significantly healthier" to live in the countryside
    </p>
    <p>
      He says research shows that air pollution is responsible for an average
      loss of life expectancy of six months across the UK and most of that is
      driven by urban populations. "More remote rural areas have half the
      concentration of pollution of urban areas." And a government report, which
      found that health outcomes are more favourable in rural areas than urban
      areas, seems to back up these findings.

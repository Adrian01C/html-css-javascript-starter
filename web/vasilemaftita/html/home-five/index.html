      By the end of this chapter, you will be able to describe the roles of HTML
      and CSS in a web page; explain the HTML DOM and CSSOM; explain how a web
      page renders; create a web page from scratch; and use CSS selectors and
      calculate CSS specificity. This chapter introduces two core technologies
      of the web â€“ HTML and CSS. We will look at how they work, how we can write
      them, and how we can use them to build web pages.
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Whether you want to create a simple web page to advertise a business, blog
      about your hobbies and interests, maintain an online community, or even
      create your own social media network, HTML and CSS are the foundational
      technologies upon which you can build for the web and are a way for you to
      get your ideas out there to as wide an audience as possible. When a web
      browser navigates to a web page, it will receive and parse an HTML
      document, which may include text, pictures, links, and other media (for
      instance, sound and video).
    </h2>
    <p>
      HTML structures this content. It gives it context, describes the content
      and tells the browser what to do with it. CSS tells the browser how to
      present the content. A set of styling rules lets the browser know how to
      render elements within the HTML document. HTML and CSS together give the
      browser the information it needs to render the web page for the user.

    <p>
      Navigate to a website and what you see is the rendered output of content
      marked up with HTML and styled with CSS. As a browser user, you have
      access to the source code of a web page. In Chrome, for example, you can
      view a page's source code with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + U on a PC or
      Cmd + U on a Mac, or right-click and choose View Page Source. Try it
      yourself. As an example, the following two figures show what the Packt
      website's Web Development portal looks like when rendered in the browser
      and as source code respectively. Ultimately, by learning how to write the
      HTML and CSS found in that source code, we can create a modern website:

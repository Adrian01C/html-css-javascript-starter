      SACRED LANDSCAPES (3500–2300 BC) New types of monuments appeared in the
      middle and late Neolithic periods, including timber circles like Woodhenge
      (about 2300 BC), earth mounds such as Silbury Hill, Wiltshire (about 2400
      BC), stone circles like Castlerigg, Cumbria (about 3000 BC), and earthwork
      henges such as Knowlton, Dorset. Henges and circles were sometimes
      combined. The stone circles at Avebury and Stonehenge (both about 2500 BC)
      are among the best examples of this. And in some places, several different
      types of monuments were built in the same area over long periods. You can
      get a good sense of these sacred landscapes at Marden Henge, Avebury and
      Stonehenge. During this period, flint for tools and weapons was being
      extracted at Grime's Graves, Norfolk (first mined between 2600 and 2200
      BC).

      BRONZE AGE (2300–800 BC) In about 2300 BC the first metal weapons and
      jewellery began to arrive in Britain, along with a new kind of pottery
      known as Beaker. People were buried with these objects in individual
      graves, some of which were covered with round barrows. At first the metal
      used was copper, but by about 2200 BC bronze (an alloy of copper and tin)
      was being worked in Britain. During the early Bronze Age, some people were
      buried in rich graves within round barrows, accompanied by exotic imported
      goods. These burials have been found in the area around Stonehenge, but
      also in Yorkshire and Derbyshire. Often these burials were grouped in
      barrow cemeteries, such as Flowerdown Barrows, Hampshire, and Winterbourne
      Poor Lot Barrows, Dorset. These rich, individual burials signify a shift
      from the great Neolithic communal monuments. During the middle and late
      Bronze Age, landscapes were divided up by great field systems and people
      built permanent round houses, often grouped into villages such as
      Grimspound in Devon. Elsewhere, competition for land and a need for
      security prompted the construction of the earliest hillforts.

      Three beautiful gold objects, dating from 1900–1700 BC, discovered during
      excavations of Bush Barrow, near Stonehenge. The large, diamond-shaped
      lozenge was a breastplate of some sort, accompanied by a belt buckle (top
      left) and what may have been a mount for a macehead (top right). This is
      the richest and one of the most significant examples of a Bronze Age
      burial in Britain.© Wiltshire Museum, Devizes

      IRON AGE (800 BC–AD 50) In the early and middle Iron Age people built
      bigger and more elaborate hillforts like Maiden Castle in Dorset and Old
      Oswestry in Shropshire. They also began to make weapons and tools out of
      iron. Evidence of ritual offerings of military equipment and fine
      metalwork suggest the dominance of a warrior aristocracy and the emergence
      of tribal territories. The late Iron Age saw the first coinage and the
      emergence of tribal centres such as Lexden Earthworks, Essex, and Stanwick
      Iron Age Fortifications, North Yorkshire. And it’s during this period that
      Britain came into contact with the Roman world, as at Silchester,
      Hampshire. And with this contact came the first written records of life on
      the island, from Greeks and Romans. The most famous notes were made by
      Julius Caesar, who raided Britain in 55–54 BC. Accounts from the period
      mention chariot warfare and religious leaders called Druids, who
      supposedly worshipped in oak groves and performed sacrifices. Nearly a
      hundred years after Caesar’s raids, the emperor Claudius ordered a full
      scale invasion – and this time the Romans intended to stay.

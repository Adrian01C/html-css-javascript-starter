      The book begins by introducing you to HTML5 and CSS3, and takes you
      through the process of website development with easy-to-follow steps.
      Exploring how the browser renders websites from code to display, you'll
      advance to adding a cinematic experience to your website by incorporating
      video and audio elements into your code. You'll also use JavaScript to add
      interactivity to your site, integrate HTML forms for capturing user data,
      incorporate animations to create slick transitions, and build stunning
      themes using advanced CSS. You'll also get to grips with mobile-first
      development using responsive design and media queries, to ensure your
      sites perform well on any device. Throughout the book, you'll work on
      engaging projects, including a video store home page that you will
      iteratively add functionality to as you learn new skills. By the end of
      this Workshop, you'll have gained the confidence to creatively tackle your
      own ambitious web development projects

      AN INTRODUCTION TO PREHISTORIC ENGLAND (BEFORE AD 43) Prehistory is the
      time before written records. It’s the period of human history we know the
      least about, but it's also the longest by far. The earliest known humans
      arrived in these lands around 900,000 years ago. Prehistory stretches from
      then until the Roman invasion in AD 43. Over this time, these lands
      underwent huge climactic, societal, political, technological and
      geological changes. Along with artefacts discovered by archaeologists, the
      henges, hillforts and burial sites still visible in the landscape today
      give us with fascinating glimpses into the lives of the people of
      prehistoric England.

    <h2>
      AGES AND AGES To deal with the massive spans of time in this period,
      archaeologists traditionally divide prehistory into three main periods:
      the Stone, Bronze and Iron ages, named after the main technologies used at
      the time. And each period is subdivided – for example, the Stone Age into
      the Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic (Old, Middle and New Stone
      Ages). These terms are seen as old-fashioned by some archaeolgists, who
      prefer to use more specific terms like Beaker period to reflect subtle
      developments in society, culture and technology. But the old, broad
      chronological divisions are still useful. Archaeologists are using some of
      the most cutting-edge technology to find out more about our distant past.
      Recent archaeological finds, as well as new scientific techniques, have
      overturned old certainties. Isotopic and DNA analysis of animal and human
      remains, chemical analysis of stone tools and pottery, and new ways of
      interpreting radiocarbon dating are all helping to challenge long-held
      ideas and raise new questions about this fascinating opening chapter of
      England’s story.

      THE EARLIEST HUMANS In 2010 archaeologists working near Happisburgh in
      Norfolk uncovered flint tools dated to about 900,000 years ago. The people
      who used them were early humans (known as hominoids) who periodically
      visited Britain in warmer eras between Ice Ages. During this time Britain
      wasn’t an island, but a peninsula of the European continent. What is now
      the river Thames ran into the North Sea at Happisburgh. The oldest human
      remains so far found in England date from about 500,000 years ago, and
      belonged to a six-foot tall man of the species Homo heidelbergensis.
      Shorter, stockier Neanderthals visited Britain between 300,000 and 35,000
      years ago, followed by the direct ancestors of modern humans. Ice Age
      humans created the earliest known cave art in England at Creswell Crags in
      Derbyshire about 13,000 years ago.

      Standing on the edge of Bodmin Moor, Trethevy Quoit (3500–2500 BC) is a
      well-preserved example of a portal dolmen, a type of monument specific to
      Cornwall. Its upright stones support a massive capstone, showing the
      considerable engineering skills needed to construct prehistoric stone
      monuments./HUNTERS AND GATHERERS (9500–4000 BC) Continuous human
      occupation of Britain began as the climate improved at the end of the last
      Ice Age. People in Britain at this time were still hunters and gatherers
      who made use of wild plants and animals. Although most of these people
      were probably nomadic, recent discoveries of buildings suggest that some
      had settled lifestyles. By about 6500 BC, rising seas had inundated the
      land bridge with Europe, making Britain an island.

      FIRST FARMERS (FROM 4000 BC) Perhaps the most important development in
      human history, farming was first introduced to Britain around 4000 BC. The
      people who brought the techniques to the island must have travelled from
      Europe by boat. Although they farmed pulses, barley and wheat, people
      still relied on wild food and resources. And rather than settle in one
      place, they still moved around within territories. These territories were
      focused on great communal monuments. Some were gathering places like the
      causewayed enclosure at Windmill Hill, Wiltshire (built about 3650 BC).
      Others were burial sites with impressive long barrows. Many had stone
      chambered tombs, such as Belas Knap, Gloucestershire, West Kennet Long
      Barrow, Wiltshire (both about 3650 BC), and Wayland's Smithy, Oxfordshire
      (about 3400 BC)./This highly polished ceremonial macehead, dating from
      3000–2500 BC, was discovered during excavations of the pits known as the
      Aubrey Holes at Stonehenge. It was found buried with cremated human
      remains, suggesting that it was a prized possession.© English Heritage

      Greece is one of those countries that youâ€™ll never get bored of visiting.
      With thousands of little islands and the gorgeous mainland, itâ€™s a place
      that just gets better with every trip. Thatâ€™s what makes a trip to some of
      the most beautiful islands in Greece a necessity. With stunning islands
      like Kefalonia, to the big (and gorgeous) islands like Crete â€“ each one
      has its own particular charm, mountains of yummy Greek food to devour, and
      plenty of stunning beaches to take a dip./Oh yeah, and if youâ€™re looking
      for someone to carry your luggage whilst youâ€™re there, just pop me a
      message! Iâ€™m already itching to go back./Take a look of 19 of the very
      best and beautiful islands in Greece you should visit this year. Youâ€™ll
      love it! Ha! ðŸ¤£
    </h3>
    <p>
      1.) Santorini./Yeah, I knowâ€¦ Iâ€™m probably starting with the most obvious
      of Greek islands, but with good reason. Iâ€™m pretty sure Santorini is the
      most famous and possibly the most beautiful islands in Greece. With its
      clifftop villages and amazing views, itâ€™s one of the unique Greek Islands
      that has been massively shaped by a volcanic eruption a few thousand years
      ago. Legend has it that the island is actually the home of Atlantis which
      was devoured by the sea quite a few millennia ago./Whatever the case,
      youâ€™re going to love it. Make sure to try some of the tasty dishes on the
      island and explore some of the prettiest sites to see once youâ€™ve arrived.

      2.) Mykonos./Mykonos is a stunner of a place, especially with all the
      little coves and quaint towns (that are soooo picturesque). Make sure to
      wander around the cobbled streets of Mykonos Town, head over to Delos
      Island on a Kaiki (small boat) and visit the monastery of Panagia
      Tourliani. Oh yeah, donâ€™t forget to see the islandâ€™s famous windmills too!
      Theyâ€™re gorgeous at sunset./For a tasty bite, head over to M-eating for
      some of their freshly caught sea bass. It really is one of the beautiful
      islands in Greece you should explore. Read more: What to see, do and eat
      in Mykonos

      3.) Corfu./Perched on the west side of Greece, Corfu is one of the larger
      northerly islands you should definitely visit. Now, thereâ€™s a common
      misconception that Corfu is all about package holidays and boozy lads
      nights out. This couldnâ€™t be further from the truth for the majority of
      the island. Yes, there are a few areas that cater to the party crowd but
      the vast majority of the island is so gorgeous and the ideal spot for us
      travellers to explore./Make sure to visit the dramatic Cape Drastis, visit
      the Vlacherna Monastery and see the stunning canal dâ€™Amour. Read more:

      4.) Crete./Crete is, without a doubt, the largest of the beautiful islands
      in Greece you should visit. The best thing about Crete is that thereâ€™s so
      much to see, meaning you can easily justify a week or two just on the
      island itself. Heck, go for a month if you want!/Whilst youâ€™re exploring
      the island, head over to Spinalonga Island to see the historic fort, take
      a boat to the isolated Greek village of Loutro and ramble around Balos
      Lagoon. Youâ€™ll get some epic views.

      5.) Rhodes./Rhodes was the first ever Greek island Iâ€™d ever visitedâ€¦ and
      what an introduction it was. whilst youâ€™re there, hop over to the village
      of Lindos, see the Acropolis and the medieval sites within the old town
      itself./For some of the tastiest dishes, pop into Ta Kardasia if youâ€™re
      hankering for some authentic Greek food. They make the best moussaka in
      all of Rhodes. Read more: The best things to do in Rhodes

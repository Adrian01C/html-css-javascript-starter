    <h1>
      More than one million homes in rural and hard-to-reach areas will have
      broadband built to them in the first phase of a £5 billion infrastructure
      project.
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Available speeds will see a boost to more than 1,000 megabits or one
      gigabit per second under the government plans. Contracts for these first
      areas will go to tender in the spring with spades in the ground in the
      first half of 2022. Projects will prioritise areas that currently have
      slow connections, including large swathes of the countryside long impacted
      by sluggish speeds.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Gigabit Broadband Voucher Scheme is also being relaunched with up to
      £210m to give people in eligible rural areas financial help to get gigabit
      speeds. Announcing the plan today (19 March), Prime Minister Boris Johnson
      said: "Project Gigabit is the rocket boost that we need to get
      lightning-fast broadband to all areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This broadband revolution will fire up people’s businesses and homes, and
      the vital public services that we all rely on, so we can continue to level
      up and build back better from this pandemic." The Country Land and
      Business Association (CLA) called the announcement an 'important moment in
      levelling up the countryside'. "Too many rural businesses are put at a
      disadvantage by poor connectivity," said Mark Bridgeman, the rural group's
      president.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The rural economy is 16% less productive than the national average,
      largely due to poor infrastructure," he said, adding that the gap's
      closure would grow the economy by at least £43bn. "This is a good start,
      but if government is serious about levelling up then it’s foot needs to
      stay on the accelerator until the job is complete.”

      Two thirds of farmers still do not wear a helmet when they ride ATVs and
      quad bikes, alarming new research suggests. The University of Aberdeen
      report found that 63.5% of respondents stated they owned a helmet but only
      a third (29.9%) reported wearing a helmet frequently or always.
    </h1>
    <h2>
      The research pinpointed several underlying factors, ranging from personal
      perceptions about helmets and personal barriers that stop farm workers
      wearing a helmet when using an ATV on their site. The study, by Dr Amy
      Irwin and Jana Mihulkova, highlighted farmers' responses such as 'I do not
      go fast enough to need head protection in a crash' and 'I feel that
      helmets are unnecessary for short rides'. Other comments in the report
      included 'helmets are only necessary for children aged 16 and below' and
      'you only need a helmet if riding on the road'.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Responding to the report, off-road vehicle brand Can-Am, which is owned by
      BRP, said it wanted to help farmers tackle this safety issue in 2021 .
      James Dalke, BRP UK commercial manager said: “The fact that people have a
      helmet and do not wear it and the reasons why they don’t, reflects a
      mindset that we are aiming to change through education." Seven rules for
      ATVs The manufacturer has issued farmers and other ATV users seven 'golden
      rules' as part of its global responsible rider programme: • Always wear
      the correct personal protective equipment such as a helmet, boots, long
      sleeve shirt and trousers when out riding • Prepare an itinerary before
      setting off and communicate it to the people close to you (colleagues,
      friends or family)
    </p>
    <p>
      • Follow the recommendations for use that are specified by the
      manufacturer in the operator’s guide as well as on the safety labels
      placed on the vehicle • Follow maintenance instructions as recommended by
      the manufacturer • Inspect the vehicle before use to make sure it is in
      good working order • Take along communication devices and breakdown
      equipment • Be mindful of the animals you come across and do not damage
      their natural habitat

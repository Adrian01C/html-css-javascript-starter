      Open Farm Sunday will be postponed by two weeks following the official
      announcement on the roadmap out of lockdown in England. Organisers LEAF
      have decided to move the date of their flagship event to Sunday 27 June,
      two weeks after the original date planned.
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Announcing the news, LEAF said they still anticipated Open Farm Sunday to
      be more popular than ever this year after months of restricted activity
      and many country shows cancelled. LOFS Manager, Annabel Shackleton said:
      “By 27 June, restrictions should be lifted for most parts of the country,
      giving our farmers and the public confidence to enjoy a safe, informative
      and fun day out on farm.” Host farmers are being asked to use a booking
      system this year, through the LOFS TryBooking ticketing service, Facebook,
      or their own, in order to avoid overcrowding.
    </h2>

      Ms Shackleton said this would help keep staff and visitors Covid-safe, and
      to inform visitors in case of any changes in plans. “Big events may not be
      practical this year, but if the public is surging to the countryside, we’d
      love to see hundreds of smaller events taking place,” she added. “This is
      an excellent opportunity to share the farming, sustainability and food
      production story, but also, crucially, how to respect the countryside as
      we head into the summer holidays.”

      LEAF is working with farmers to produce a series of films offering support
      on hosting events, and guidance on complying with Covid-safe measures.
      More details will follow later this month, the organisation said.

      An out-of-control dog has massacred seven pregnant sheep in Devon, leading
      the police to issue a warning to the public. The incident happened in the
      Parracombe area between 3pm on Tuesday 9 March and 10am on Thursday 11
      March. All seven of the Swaledale ewes were carrying twins, according to
      police. The sheep were likely attacked by a dog or multiple dogs. "All
      these Swaledale Ewes were carrying twins," Lynton Police said on social
      media.
    </h1>
    <p>
      The force added the incident happened "in a fenced field which had a
      public footpath going through it, and not on open moorland." Lynton Police
      said: "Please keep your dog under control and on a lead around livestock,
      it is a criminal offence to allow your dog to chase, bite or injure
      livestock. "If you have seen or heard anything in relation to this crime,
      please contact the police quoting the crime number CR/019090/21 by ringing
      101 or email 101@dc.police.uk." According to figures released by NFU
      Mutual, livestock worrying cost farmers across the UK £1.3 million in
      2020. Rothamsted Enterprises Based in Harpenden, Hertfordshire. Office

      A new agriculture magazine for kids has launched aiming to dispel farming
      myths and engage with children from a non-farming background.
    </h1>
    <h2>
      The 'YoungStock' magazine is a new 32-page publication which wants to
      encourage 7 to 11 year olds to get involved with the environment, food
      production and seasonality. The monthly magazine was founded by cattle
      farmer Emma Smith, who said she had a strong vision to inform and
      collaborate with the farming industry. “I want to shine a light on our
      farmers and our food producers; to provide our young readers with facts
      and information to enable them to make informed decisions by themselves.

      "But it is also about encouraging reluctant readers and enticing
      non-farming children into our vast, knowledgeable industry,” Ms Smith
      said. The magazine seeks to empower the younger generation to think more
      about the perceived issues surrounding agriculture. The publication also
      wants to engage as many different voices as possible to showcase the wide
      range of careers available in the industry. In the first edition, features
      included skidsteers and alpacas, to dairy farming in Cornwall and the
      livestock sector in the United States. It also touches on hard-hitting
      issues such as bird flu, owning a farm, Brexit and robots - topics which
      children 'should not shy away from'.

      Ms Smith added: “YoungStock is about both looking to the future and
      reflecting on what is happening in the industry, that will ultimately
      impact our readers. "It is important that it tackles some of the difficult
      subjects in a tone that appeals to our young audience and to encourage
      discussion. "It is also about encouraging them to participate and help
      shape the publication as it evolves.” YoungStock costs £3.99 per month and
      is available on subscription.

      Nine heavily pregnant ewes have died after a fly-tipper dumped highly
      toxic garden plants on farmland in North Wales. North Wales Police (NWP)
      Rural Crime Team shared details of the incident on social media, including
      a graphic image of the dead sheep.
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Posting on Twitter on Sunday 14 March, the force said the in-lamb ewes
      would have suffered a 'horrendous death'. "This is the direct result of
      somebody fly-tipping garden clippings into a field of sheep," the team
      said, adding that a lot of garden plants were highly toxic to animals.
      "Due to this selfish act, nine heavily pregnant ewes have suffered a
      horrendous death leaving the farmer heartbroken."

      The Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) recently warned farmers on
      the risk of plant poisoning in sheep, particularly from ornamental garden
      plants. The majority of outbreaks of poisoning by plants in sheep occur
      over the winter months when grass is scarce, the institute said. The most
      common plants in poison cases are those of the Ericaceaea family which
      include Azaleas, Rhododendron and Pieris species such as 'Forest flame'.
      Pieris spp in particular account for a large proportion of cases submitted
      for post mortem, the AFBI explained.
    </p>

      These plants contain the toxin acetylandromedol, a substance which is very
      poisonous to sheep. Poisoning due to Ivy can also occur in sheep, it
      added, and whilst it is used in livestock as a traditional folk tonic,
      ingestion of large quantities can cause death in sheep. "Clinical signs of
      plant poisoning in sheep occur a few hours after ingestion. The animal
      will become dull, salivate and may vomit," the institute said."The animal
      may develop obvious abdominal pain and may develop nervous signs if it
      lives long enough. Frequently, the animal will become recumbent and die.
      "It is important to check fields for ornamental shrubs before using for
      grazing. Garden clippings can also cause outbreaks if not disposed of
      safely."

      AN INTRODUCTION TO ROMAN BRITAIN (AD 43–C.410) To the Roman world, Britain
      was an unknown and mysterious land across the sea when Julius Caesar
      invaded in 55–54 BC. Despite inflicting defeats on the British, Caesar
      soon made peace with his opponents and returned to Gaul. For almost a
      century afterwards the kingdoms of Britain were kept quiet with gifts and
      diplomacy. But when anti-Roman rulers came to power, the emperor Claudius
      – in need of a boost to his domestic prestige – launched a full-scale
      invasion in AD 43, intent on regime change and military glory.

      INVASION AND CONQUEST This time the Romans enjoyed rapid military success.
      But gradual advance through southern England and Wales was halted in AD 60
      by the rebellion of Boudicca, queen of the Iceni of East Anglia, incensed
      by the brutality of the conquest. The revolt was suppressed, but not
      before three recently founded Roman cities, Camulodunum (Colchester),
      Verulamium (St Albans) and Londinium (London), had been burned to the
      ground. The advance resumed in AD 70 with the conquest of Wales and the
      north. The governor Agricola (AD 77–83) even succeeded in defeating the
      Scottish tribes at the Battle of Mons Graupius in AD 83. Immediately after
      this victory, though, troops were pulled out of Britain to deal with
      invasions on the Danube frontier. As a result, the far north could not be
      held, and the army gradually fell back to the Tyne–Solway isthmus. It was
      here that the emperor Hadrian, visiting Britain in AD 122, ordered the
      building of his famous wall. The emperor Antoninus Pius tried to reoccupy
      Scotland and built the short-lived Antonine Wall (AD 140–60). He was
      ultimately unsuccessful, however, and Hadrian’s Wall became the northern
      frontier of the province once more.

      ROMAN ORDER By now the three legions (army units of up to 6,000 men)
      remaining in Britain had settled in permanent bases. Auxiliary troops were
      scattered in smaller forts, mostly across northern England and along
      Hadrian’s Wall. In the pacified parts of the province, cities had been
      founded as capitals for each of the tribal areas (the civitates) into
      which the Britons had been organised. A network of roads had developed,
      and landowners in the south began to build Roman-style villas. Life for
      most ordinary Britons, who were farmers in the countryside, was slow to
      change. By degrees, however, they came into contact with villas, towns and
      markets. Here they could exchange their produce for Roman-style goods and
      see people dressing and behaving in Roman ways./This cornelian intaglio
      (engraved design) depicting winged Victory signing a shield is one of the
      finest ever found in Britain. Originally part of a signet ring, it was
      found at Lullingstone Villa in Kent. It may have been the personal seal of
      Pertinax, governor of Britain in AD 185–6 and later, briefly, Roman
      emperor

      DIVISION OF BRITAIN Shortly after AD 180 there was an invasion by tribes
      from what is now Scotland, who overran Hadrian’s Wall. Around this time
      most of the cities of Britain were enclosed within earthen defensive
      walls, which may have been linked to the invasion. The Roman Empire was
      ruled from Britain for a brief period in AD 208–11, when the emperor
      Septimius Severus came to campaign north of Hadrian’s Wall. Severus
      divided Britain into two provinces, Britannia Superior (south) and
      Inferior (north), with capitals at London and York respectively. This
      prevented too many troops from being concentrated in the hands of a single
      governor who might have attempted to usurp power.

      One of Britain’s most remote and dramatically sited Roman forts, Hardknott
      in Cumbria was established in the reign of Hadrian (AD 117–38). After it
      was abandoned in the early 3rd century, the fort was used as a shelter by
      travellers and passing patrols
